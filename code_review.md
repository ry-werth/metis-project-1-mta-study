## Clean Code:
* Code follows PEP-8
* Clean and readable
* Good use of modular functions

## Good Documentation:
* Made use of descriptive function and variable names
* Good use of docstrings
* Suggest further use of markdown cells (and comments) to explain workflow and thought process


## Proper Data Science:
* Great visualizations and use of additional libraries
* Thorough exploration of place/time cross sections
* Consider exploring the sk-learn library for some alternative normalization methods

## Comments:
* Clean code and thorough analysis, just explain the workflow a bit more in notebooks and clean the repo
* Use a full line or a linebreak tag for multiple lines in markdown
* It's nice if you save your markdown files with outputs in case re-running is difficult or time-consuming
* Remove redundant or unecessary files such as unused .png's
